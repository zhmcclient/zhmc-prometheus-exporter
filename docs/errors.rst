Trouble shooting
================

This section describes some issues and how to resolve them. If you encounter
an issue that is not covered here, see :ref:`Reporting issues`.

Permission error
----------------

Example:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ zhmc_prometheus_exporter
  Permission error. Make sure you have appropriate permissions to read from
    /etc/zhmc-prometheus-exporter/hmccreds.yaml.

You don't have permission to read from a YAML file. Change the permissions with
``chmod``, check ``man chmod`` if you are unfamiliar with it.

File not found
--------------

Example:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ zhmc_prometheus_exporter
  Error: File not found. It seems that /etc/zhmc-prometheus-exporter/hmccreds.yaml does not exist.

A required YAML file (``hmccreds.yaml`` and ``metrics.yaml``) does not exist.
Make sure that you specify paths, relative or absolute, with ``-c`` or ``-m``
if the file is not in ``etc/zhmc-prometheus-exporter/``. You have to copy the
HMC credentials file from the ``examples`` folder and fill in your own
credentials, see :ref:`Quickstart` for more information.

Section not found
-----------------

Example:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ zhmc_prometheus_exporter
  Section metric_groups not found in file /etc/zhmc-prometheus-exporter/metrics.yaml.

At least one of the sections ``metric_groups`` and ``metrics`` in your
``metrics.yaml`` or ``metrics`` in ``hmccreds.yaml`` is missing in its
entirety. See chapter :ref:`Metric definition file` for more information.

Doesn't follow the YAML syntax
------------------------------

Example:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ zhmc_prometheus_exporter
  /etc/zhmc-prometheus-exporter/metrics.yaml does not follow the YAML syntax

A YAML file you specified breaks the syntax rules of the YAML specification.
If you derive your YAML files from the existing examples (see chapter
:ref:`Quickstart`), this error should not occur, you can also check the
`YAML specification`_.

.. _Quickstart: ./intro.rst#quickstart
.. _YAML specification: http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html

You did not specify
-------------------

Example:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ zhmc_prometheus_exporter
  You did not specify the IP address of the HMC in /etc/zhmc-prometheus-exporter/hmccreds.yaml.

There is a lot of mandatory information in the two YAML files that might be
missing if you improperly filled the credentials file (see :ref:`Quickstart`)
or made bad changes to the metrics file (see :ref:`Metric definition file`).

All of these values could in some way be missing or incorrect:

**In the credentials YAML file, in the section "metrics"**

* ``hmc``, the IP address of the HMC (it must be a correct IP address as well!)
* ``userid``, a username for the HMC
* ``password``, the respective password

**In the metrics YAML file, in the section "metric_groups", for each metric group**

* ``prefix``, the prefix for the metrics to be exported
* ``fetch``, specifying whether the group should be fetched (it must be one of
  ``True`` or ``False`` as well!)

**In the metrics YAML file, in the section "metrics", for each metric group**

* The group must also exist in the ``metric_groups`` section
* ``percent``, specifying whether the metric is a percent value (it must be one
  of ``True`` or ``False`` as well!)
* ``exporter_name``, the name for the exporter (minus the prefix)
* ``exporter_desc``, the mandatory description for the exporter

Time out
--------

Example:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ zhmc_prometheus_exporter
  Time out. Ensure that you have access to the HMC and that you have stored
    the correct IP address in /etc/zhmc-prometheus-exporter/hmccreds.yaml.

There is a certain timeout threshold if the HMC cannot be found. Check that
you have access to the HMC on the IP address that you specified in the
HMC credentials file.

Authentication error
--------------------

Example:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ zhmc_prometheus_exporter
  Authentication error. Ensure that you have stored a correct user ID-password
    combination in /etc/zhmc-prometheus-exporter/hmccreds.yaml.

Wrong username or password in the HMC credentials file. Check if you can regularly
access the HMC with this username-password combination.

Warning: Skipping metric or metric group
----------------------------------------

Example:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ zhmc_prometheus_exporter
  ...: UserWarning: Skipping metric group 'new-metric-group' returned by the HMC that is
    not defined in the 'metric_groups' section of metric definition file metrics.yaml
    warnings.warn(warning_str % (metric, filename))

  $ zhmc_prometheus_exporter
  ...: UserWarning: Skipping metric 'new-metric' of metric group 'new-metric-group'
    returned by the HMC that is not defined in the 'metrics' section of metric
    definition file metrics.yaml
    warnings.warn(warning_str % (metric, filename))

If the HMC implements new metrics, or if the metric definition file misses a
metric or metric group, the exporter issues ths warning to make you aware
of that.
