Usage
=====

This page describes how to use the exporter beyond following the quickstart guide.

Revision: Quickstart
--------------------

To sign into the HMC, you have to provide credentials in the YAML format. The file ``hmccreds.yaml`` could look something like this (see also the example file shown in :ref:`sample credentials YAML`):

.. code-block:: yaml

    metrics:
      hmc: 10.10.10.10
      userid: user
      password: password

Furthermore, the file ``metrics.yaml`` defines details about the metrics fetching. An example file is shown in :ref:`sample metrics YAML`, for more information on its anatomy see chapter :ref:`The metrics YAML file`.

Put both of these files into ``/etc/zhmc-prometheus-exporter`` (or link them). You can then run

.. code-block:: bash

  $ zhmc_prometheus_exporter

The default port is 9291, you can change it with ``-p``. If you do not want to put ``hmccreds.yaml`` and ``metrics.yaml`` into ``/etc/zhmc-prometheus-exporter``, you can also specify them with ``-c`` and ``-m`` respectively.

Output anatomy
--------------

All metrics are of the Prometheus specific type Gauge. They are grouped into prefixes, e.g. ``dpm`` for general metrics read in the Dynamic Partition Manager (DPM) mode, or ``lpar`` for logical partitions in classic mode. The suffix of a metric represents the unit of measurement; for instance, a percent value will usually end with ``usage_ratio``, while a temperature would end in ``celsius``.

In the case of many of the metrics, they apply to multiple devices. The ``dpm`` group can have several CPCs, the ``partition`` group will usually have several partitions, etc. These devices are separated with labels, the label being ``resource`` and the value being the CPC name, the partition name, etc.

Available metrics
-----------------
This is an easier to read version of the relevant parts from the `HMC Web Services API Documentation`_. On the first level, you can read the metric groups and their prefixes. They will additionally be prefixed with ``zhmc_``. On the second level, you can read the metrics and their exporter name without the prefix.

The metrics YAML file
---------------------

Various properties about scraping are collected from the ``metrics.yaml`` file that is given to the exporter with the ``-m`` option.

The metric groups section
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

contains the metric groups, as seen on the first level of the lists in :ref:`Available metrics`.

Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

  dpm-system-usage-overview:
    prefix: dpm
    fetch: True

Within one section, the metric prefix and the fetch True/False value is stored. Note that the former will additionally be prefixed with ``zhmc_``. The latter is due to runtime concerns: Some metric groups take over a second to be scraped.

The metrics section
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

contains the metrics themselves, as seen on the second level of the lists in :ref:`Available metrics`.

Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

  dpm-system-usage-overview:
    network-usage:
      percent: True
      exporter_name: network_usage_ratio
      exporter_desc: DPM total network usage

The first level section is the metric group, the second level section is the metric. Within one metric section, a percent True/False value is stored, as well as the name and description for the exporter. The former is required because for the HMC, 100% means 100, whereas for Prometheus, 100% means 1. The latter two are requirements for an exporter, the ``exporter_name`` will be prepended with the group prefix and an underscore.
