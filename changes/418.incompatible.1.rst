Changed the format of the exporter config file (previously referred to as
"HMC credentials file") to add controls for enabling or disabling the export
of the metric groups, and to clean up some naming idiosyncrasies on that
opportunity. The old config file format is still supported and is automatically
upgraded internally (or the file itself, see the support for the
'--upgrade-config' option). As part of that config file upgrade, all metric
groups are enabled by default. If you had edited the metric definition file
in exporter version 1.x to disable some metric groups, you need to do that
again in the upgraded exporter config file.
