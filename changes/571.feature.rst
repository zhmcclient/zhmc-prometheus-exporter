Support for upgrading a config file (= HMC credentials file) from exporter
version 1.x to the current version. By default, the exporter configuration is
upgraded internally without persisting the changes. A new '--upgrade-config'
command line option can be used to upgrade the exporter config file. This
required using the 'ruamel.yaml' Python package, in order to preserve comments
in the exporter config file.
