Improved performance of the startup phase with a consolidated new resource
cache. So far, there were three caches in the exporter that were built for
specific purposes. That has lead to fetching the same resources multiple times
from the HMC and fetching a larger set of resource properties than minimally
needed. The new resource cache fetches each resource only once and only with
the smallest possible set of properties. That should reduce the duration of
the startup phase.
