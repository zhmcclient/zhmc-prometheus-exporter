Changed the format of the exporter config file (previously referred to as
"HMC credentials file") to add controls for enabling or disabling the export
of the metric groups, and to clean up some naming idiosyncrasies on that
opportunity. The old format is now deprecated and support for it will be
removed in a future release.
