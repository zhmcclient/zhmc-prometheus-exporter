Improved the handling of missing object access permissions: Resources of
enabled metric groups now may be inaccessible which causes their metrics not to
be exported. That had always been documented that way, but the implementation
did not step up to that. However, the direct and indirect parent resources of
accessible resources of enabled metric groups also must be accessible.
