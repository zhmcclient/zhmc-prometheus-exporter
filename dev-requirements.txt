# Coverage reporting (no imports, invoked via coveralls script):
# coveralls versions 4.0.0/4.0.1 have increased their pinning of coverage to <8,
#   but they have also added a constraint for Python to <3.13. Due to that
#   Python pinning, we need to use the older coverage and coveralls versions on
#   Python>=3.13.
# Note: The earlier repetition of pinnings to avoid pip backtracking no longer
#       seems to be needed.
