# Pip constraints file for install dependencies.
#
# This file specifies constraints that match the minimum versions specified in
# the requirement files for install. They are used for example when setting up
# test environments with the minimum versions of any dependent packages.

# Make sure that the package versions in minimum-constraints.txt are also
# the minimum versions required in requirements.txt and dev-requirements.txt.


# Base dependencies (must be consistent with base-requirements.txt)
