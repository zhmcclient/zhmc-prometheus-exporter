The **IBM Z HMC Prometheus Exporter** is a `Prometheus exporter`_ written in
Python that retrieves metrics from the `IBM Z`_ Hardware Management Console (HMC)
and exports them to the `Prometheus`_ monitoring system.

The exporter attempts to stay up as much as possible, for example it performs
automatic session renewals with the HMC if the logon session expires, and it
survives HMC reboots and automatically picks up metrics collection again once
the HMC come back up.

Quickstart
----------

* Install the exporter and all of its Python dependencies as follows:

  .. code-block:: bash

      $ pip install zhmc-prometheus-exporter

* Provide an *HMC credentials file* for use by the exporter.

  The HMC credentials file tells the exporter which HMC to talk to for
  obtaining metrics, and which userid and password to use for logging on to
  the HMC.

  Download the `sample HMC credentials file`_ as ``hmccreds.yaml`` and edit
  that copy accordingly.

  For details, see `HMC credentials file`_.

.. _sample HMC credentials file: https://zhmc-prometheus-exporter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html#sample-hmc-credentials-file

* Provide a *metric definition file* for use by the exporter.

  The metric definition file maps the metrics returned by the HMC to metrics
  exported to Prometheus.

  Furthermore, the metric definition file allows optimizing the access time to
  the HMC by disabling the fetching of metrics that are not needed.

  Download the `sample metric definition file`_ as ``metrics.yaml``. It can
  be used as it is and will have all metrics enabled and mapped properly. You
  only need to edit the file if you want to adjust the metric names, labels, or
  metric descriptions, or if you want to optimize access time by disabling
  metrics not needed.

  For details, see `Metric definition file`_.

.. _sample metric definition file: https://zhmc-prometheus-exporter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html#sample-metric-definition-file

* Run the exporter as follows:

  .. code-block:: bash

      $ zhmc_prometheus_exporter -c hmccreds.yaml -m metrics.yaml
      Exporter is up and running on port 9291

  Depending on the number of CPCs managed by your HMC, and dependent on how many
  metrics are enabled, it will take some time until the exporter reports to be
  up and running. You can see what it does in the mean time by using the ``-v``
  option. Subsequent requests to the exporter will be sub-second.

* Direct your web browser at http://localhost:9291 to see the exported
  Prometheus metrics. Refreshing the browser will update the metrics.
